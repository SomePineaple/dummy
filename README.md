# Dummy

The point of this project is to be able to play Rummy 500 in a manner of different ways. Currently, the signal-client allows you to play remotely with a friend provided you have a working installation of signal-cli. This also is quite broken. There is an AI bot currently in development that you will eventually be able to play against.
